        "summary": "Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods. The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam. It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy. But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. \"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,\" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living. Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009. This could undo years of conservation efforts. \"It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,\" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. A 2023 studypublishedin the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours \"may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive\". Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project. \"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,\" he said. The government official admitted that there would be a potential \"challenge\" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that \"the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts\". The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song. \"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,\" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power. \"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?\" Mahesh Adivasi said. The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given. Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. \"In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,\" he added. But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees. \"Can a house be built with this much money?\" he asked. Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future. \"The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness,\"  said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20. Questions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river. Critics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield. Mr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities \"have all the data to continue with the project\". Mr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting \"a dangerous precedent\" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas. \"And for those affected, it once again underscores how development in India often comes at the cost of the most marginalised,\" he added.

        "summary": "India and the UK will restart free trade talks on Monday, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, is in Delhi, where he will meet his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal to kick off the two-day discussions. Ahead of the meeting, Reynoldssaidit was a \"no-brainer\" to seek a trade deal with India, which was forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach. Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and demands to relax fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a \"top priority\" for his government. \"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to imposereciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffson imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30. The UK had announced inNovemberlast year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year. The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries. London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars. India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times. It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits. During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram. UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru. After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has beensigningagreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs.

        "summary": "An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed. Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe. This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities. Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma doesn't flinch. \"OK,\" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding \"nowadays, this is business.\" It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa. In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets. \"The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,\" says Maham, \"like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it.\" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have \"wasted our lives\". The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs. When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals. It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana. We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics. The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are \"devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria\". In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol. The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol. Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol. West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown. In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225. He told the BBC's undercover team that \"scientists\" working in his factory could combine different drugs to \"make a new product\".  People outside the UK canwatch the documentary on YouTube. Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol \"gives the effects of an opioid\" including very deep sleep. \"It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,\" he explained. \"And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.\" Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations. When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even \"more severe\" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. \"It's a fairly painful experience.\" He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail \"does not sound like a rational combination\", he said. \"This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.\" In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond. The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system. It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems. The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice. Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa. These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (£22bn) a year. Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: \"Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face… with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care… describing it simply as business.\" Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized. \"We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,\" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, \"so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs\". But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the \"sellers and suppliers\" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery.

        "summary": "US President Donald Trump's remark that his country spent $21m to boost voter turnout in India's elections has triggered a political slugfest in the country. He made the remark days after a team led by Elon Musksaidit had cancelled the payout as part of its crackdown on aUS agency providing foreign aid. India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called the payout an \"external interference\" and accused the opposition Congress party of seeking this intervention. The Congress denied the allegation, calling Trump's claims \"nonsensical\". The US has not provided any evidence to support its claim. On Friday, India's foreign ministry said it found the claims \"deeply troubling\". Foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it was \"premature\" to make public statements about the matter at this stage and that relevant authorities were investigating it. Trump vowed to boost the US economy and soon after returning to office, he created the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led by Musk, to slash federal spending and jobs. Musk says Doge's mission is to save taxpayer money and cut national debt. One of its biggest moves - now making global headlines - is a crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid since the 1960s. Musk, who has called USAID a \"criminal organisation\", announced on Sunday that funding for several projects had been cancelled. The cuts included $486m for the \"Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening\", with \"$21m for voter turnout in India\" and \"$22m for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova\". Defending Doge's cuts, Trump said India \"had a lot of money\" and was among the world's highest-taxing nations. On Thursday, he doubled down, questioning the $21m spend on \"India's voter turnout\". The latest comments came a week after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first Washington visit under Trump's second term, where Trump announced expanded military sales, increased energy exports and plans for a trade deal and new defence framework. \"I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government,\" the US president said at a summit in Miami. The same day, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a clip of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi speaking at an event in London before the 2024 general election. In the clip, Gandhi can be heard saying that major democracies like the US and European countries were \"oblivious that a huge chunk of democratic model has come undone [in India]\". \"Rahul Gandhi was in London, urging foreign powers - from the US to Europe - to intervene in India's internal affairs,\" Malviya alleged in his post on X. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh dismissed the claim and urged the government to report on USAID's decades-long support to governmental and non-governmental institutions during PM Modi's tenure. Despite widespread reports, neither Doge nor Trump has provided evidence that USAID gave India $21m for voter turnout. India's poll panel has not responded, but former election chief SY Qureshi denied receiving such funding during his tenure, which ran from 2010 to 2012. Earlier, Malviya claimed that in 2012, under Mr Qureshi, the panel signed an agreement with a group linked to George Soros' foundation - primarily funded by USAID - to support a voter turnout campaign. Mr Qureshi dismissed the allegation as \"malicious\", stating that the agreement explicitly imposed \"no financial or legal obligation on either side\". On Friday, the Indian Express newspaper said in an investigativereportthat the $21m was sanctioned for Bangladesh and not India. It was meant to run for three years until July 2025 and that $13.4m had already been spent, according to records accessed by the newspaper. The incident last week comes months after he allegedly called a winery worker a \"loser\". British trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds is in Delhi to kick-start two days of discussions on the deal. Trump said Bongino was \"a man of incredible love and passion for our Country\" and would serve under newly confirmed FBI director Kash Patel. The project aims to channel surplus Ken river water to a drought-prone region. In addition to some 4,200 staff who are being placed on leave, at least 1,600 employees are being fired.

        "summary": "The FBI's new director, Kash Patel, has vowed to \"rebuild\" the bureau after he was confirmed by the US Senate to lead the law-enforcement agency that he has long attacked. The upper chamber of Congress narrowly approved President Donald Trump's nominee by 51-49. Two Republicans voted no. Democrats had warned he would seek retribution against Trump's enemies, although the nominee has denied any plans to pursue political vendettas. In his confirmation hearings, Patel, 44, also denied keeping a list of \"deep state\" enemies, while playing down controversial past remarks he had made such as referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as \"criminal gangsters\". Patel was voted against by all Democratic senators and two Republicans who have often dissented, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. He was the 18th cabinet official approved by lawmakers since Trump was inaugurated a month ago. \"I am honored to be confirmed as the ninth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,\" Patel said on X, shortly after he was confirmed by the Senate. \"My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops - and rebuild trust in the FBI.\" \"We will rebuild an FBI the American people can be proud of,\" he added. Patel takes the helm of an FBI in flux after the justice department forced out some of its top officials and demanded the names of agents who investigated the 2021 riot by Trump supporters at the US Capitol. News of Patel's confirmation was greeted by an ovation on the other side of Washington DC where Republicans were gathering for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Florida Senator Rick Scott stood on CPAC's stage and asked the crowd: \"What do you think about Kash Patel?\" Loud applause was the response. To most Republicans, Patel is a disruptor who will lead an overdue shake up the nation's top law enforcement agency, which they and Trump claim has been weaponised against conservatives. But Democrats say Patel is a far-right conspiracy theorist with little experience in law enforcement, and someone who would put fealty to Trump above his oath to lead a department that is meant to operate independently. \"[Patel's] poor judgment and lack of experience make him wholly unqualified to keep Americans safe as our FBI Director. I voted no,\" Senator Martin Heinrich said on X. Patel replaces Christopher Wray who Trump picked in 2017. Wray resigned before inauguration day last month, after the incoming Republican president indicated he would fire him. Some departments encouraged staff to respond, while others requested employees wait for further guidance. The weekend email comes as Elon Musk leads an effort to aggressively curtail the government workforce. Like 1968 or 1989, this could be a year when the world changes in a fundamental way.

        "summary": "India and the UK will restart free trade talks on Monday, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, is in Delhi, where he will meet his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal to kick off the two-day discussions. Ahead of the meeting, Reynoldssaidit was a \"no-brainer\" to seek a trade deal with India, which was forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach. Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and demands to relax fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a \"top priority\" for his government. \"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to imposereciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffson imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30. The UK had announced inNovemberlast year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year. The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries. London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars. India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times. It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits. During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram. UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru. After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has beensigningagreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, itsigneda $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations. It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year. Follow BBC News India onInstagram,YouTube,TwitterandFacebook.

        "summary": "This video can not be played Kohli stars as India beat Pakistan by five wickets ICC Champions Trophy Group A, Dubai Pakistan 241 (49.4 overs):Saud 62, Rizwan 46; Kuldeep 3-40 India 244-4 (42.3 overs):Kohli 100* Shreyas 56; Shaheen 2-74 India won by six wickets Scorecard;Tables Virat Kohli hit a composed unbeaten century as India beat Pakistan by six wickets which put them on the cusp of reaching the Champions Trophy semi-finals and left their opponents on the brink of elimination. Pakistan mustered a rather unthreatening total of 241 after they won the toss and batted first, lacking power, intent and belief against a disciplined India attack. Saud Shakeel and Muhammad Rizwan top scored with 62 and 46 respectively, but they fashioned them off a rather ponderous 76 and 77 balls each. Khushdil Shah boosted the total with a late cameo - whacking 38 off 39 balls - but Pakistan's total felt light at a ground where the average first-innings winning score in one-day internationals is 258. Spinner Kuldeep Yadav finished the pick of India's bowlers with 3-40 while Hardik Pandya's economical eight overs brought him 2-31. Pakistan's hopes flickered when a brutal yorker from left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi swung into India captain Rohit Sharma's middle stump in the fifth over. However, from that point it was a relative cakewalk for India as Kohli guided them to the target with his usual elan en route to his 51st ODI century. Abrar Ahmed produced a fizzing leg-break to dismiss Shubman Gill for 46 with a beauty although it only staved off the inevitable. Shreyas Iyer made an enterprising 56 but the day belonged to Kohli as his hundred off 111 balls, featuring seven fours, guided India home with 45 balls to spare. Ever the showman, Kohli gave the crowd at the Dubai International Stadium a signature moment as he reached three figures in the process of wrapping up the win. With two runs left for victory, and Kohli on 96, the 36-year-old thrashed a powerful drive off Khushdil through extra cover for four to send the India fans wild. India have two victories from their opening two group matches and sit top of Group A while Pakistan have lost both and are at the foot of the table. Should New Zealand beat Bangladesh on Monday then India's place in the knockout phase will be assured along with the Kiwis, and Pakistan will be out. Recap: Kohli times victory to perfection against Pakistan Champions Trophy tables, top run-scorers and wicket-takers This video can not be played Rizwan finally breaks Pakistan's 54-ball spell without a boundary A perpetual narrative around Pakistan is their mercurial nature - a team with mavericks capable of beating any other side on their day. Maybe, it's time to dispense with it. Pakistan's jack-in-the-box surprise element now feels akin to a cliche from a bygone era. The circus is still in town, but the trapeze artists, tightrope walkers and other eye-catching acts are no more. Atepid defeat to New Zealandin their opening game was followed by another disappointing showing in a match which mattered most for the Champions Trophy holders â against their biggest rivals, and upon which the continuation of their title defence would practically rest. Once again Pakistan's fragile and stodgy top order failed to muster the runs which would prove a real challenge to their Indian counterparts. Rizwan and Saud ensured respectability, with a 104-run stand for the third wicket, but much of Pakistan's approach with the bat felt like a template for noble defeat. Haris Rauf, with eight off seven balls, had a strike-rate of 114.28 and was the only player in Pakistan's batting line-up to score at better than a run a ball. They chewed up 147 dot balls in 49.4 overs. The pitch played its part, of course. India squeezed Pakistan through the middle overs, and no boundaries were scored from the first ball of the 16th over to the second of the 25th on a slow surface. Rizwan and Shakeel eventually attempted to up the ante but it brought their inevitable downfall â bowled by Axar Patel, and caught in the deep off Hardik. In the Champions Trophy in 2017, Pakistan lost to India by a whopping 127 runs in the group stage. Fourteen days later, they werecrowned championsafter beating India after an X-Factor knock at The Oval by Fakhar Zaman - ruled out of this tournament after he picked up an injury in the first game. With their hopes now resting on an unlikely series of results a repeat seems a very distant prospect this year.  Virat Kohli's wagon wheel from his 100* off 111 balls against Pakistan With such a modest total, India had the luxury of being able to dictate the pace of their chase, and a player who has frequently been the scourge of Pakistan bowlers inevitably played the leading hand. In 17 ODI innings against Pakistan, Kohli has now scored 778 runs at an average of 59.84 with four centuries. No India player with 500-plus ODI runs in the format averages more against Pakistan. Kohli rarely seemed to break sweat during a chanceless knock which featured shots around the ground, and was characterised by powerful drives, waspish cuts and clinical punishment of anything short. It took Kohli beyond 14,000 ODI runs in 63 fewer innings than his idol Sachin Tendulkar, who is the leading run-scorer in the format. Tendulkar's 18,426 ODI runs might prove just out of reach for Kohli but he is well within striking distance of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, who is second on the all-time list with 14,234. One record Kohli did bag was most ODI catches for India as he pouched his 158th and leapfrogged Mohammad Azharuddin (156) and into top spot. The elephant in the room is this match wasplayed in the United Arab Emirates, where India will play of all their fixtures for this tournament. Political tensions mean the two countries have not faced each other outside of men's major tournaments since 2013, while India have not played in Pakistan since 2008. Pakistan would doubtless have benefitted from passionate home support - their fans were outnumbered by India's in Dubai - but regardless of the venue, Kohli would have taken some stopping. This video can not be played 'Vintage Kohli' - India's Virat Kohli best shots against Pakistan India batter Virat Kohli:\"It feels good to be able to bat in that manner. To contribute in a situation like that. My job is to help my team. I'm going to put my 100% in every game. \"I have a decent understanding of my game over the years. It's about keeping the noise and distractions away. I had to take care of my energy levels and my thoughts. It's easy for me to get pulled into the expectations and frenzy of these games.\" India captain Rohit Sharma:\"Virat loves representing the country. He wants to be out there playing for the team and doing what he does best, which is what he did today. People in the dressing room aren't surprised with what he did. \"I think the way we started with the ball was a great effort from the bowling unit. We wanted to back the experience that we have in our batting line-up to go and get those runs.\" Pakistan captain Muhammad Rizwan:\"We thought 280 was a good score on that pitch but their bowlers bowled very well. Myself and Saud Shakeel took our time because we wanted to go deep but after that, there was some poor shot selection. \"They bowled very well, put us under pressure, and that's why we only got 240. When you lose, it means you didn't perform in all departments. They were more attacking and we didn't get the wickets we wanted. We failed to squeeze [them].\" This video can not be played 'World-class' - India's Kohli reaches 14,000 ODI runs Pakistan face Bangladesh in Rawalpindi in their final group match on Thursday.

        "summary": "Indian authorities have banned two highly-addictive opioids in response to a BBC investigation which found they were fuelling a public health crisis in parts of West Africa. In a letter seen by the BBC from India's Drugs Controller General, Dr Rajeev Singh Raghuvanshi said permission to manufacture and export the drugs had been withdrawn BBC Eye found one pharmaceutical company, Aveo, had been illegally exportinga harmful mix of tapentadol and carisoprodol in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire. India's Food and Drug Administration said the company's factory in Mumbai had since been raided and its entire stock seized. The circular from Dr Raghuvanshi, dated to Friday, cited the BBC investigation in his decision to ban all combinations of tapentadol and carisoprodol, which was to be implemented with immediate effect. He said this also came after officials had looked into \"the potential of drug abuse and its harmful impact on population\". Tapentadol is a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol is a muscle relaxant so addictive it is banned in Europe. Carisoprodol is approved for use in the US, but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia and hallucinations. The combination of the two drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world as they can cause breathing difficulties and seizures and an overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, has shipped millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. The BBC World Service also found packets of these pills with the Aveo logo for sale on the streets of Nigeria, and in Ivoirian towns and cities. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to the nation's National Bureau of Statistics. As part of the investigation, the BBC also sent an undercover operative - posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria - inside one of Aveo's factories in India, where they filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma in response replies \"OK,\" before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding that \"nowadays, this is business\". Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals did not respond to a request for comment when the BBC's initial investigation was published. India's Food and Drug Administration said a sting operation saw Aveo's entire stock seized and further production halted in a statement on Friday. Further legal action will be taken against the company, it added. The agency said it was \"fully prepared\" to take action against anyone involved in \"illegal activities that tarnish the reputation of the country\". The FDA has been instructed to carry out further inspections to prevent the supply of the drugs, it said.

        "summary": "A New Jersey man who stabbed renowned British-Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage has been convicted of attempted murder and assault. Hadi Matar, 27, now faces a sentence of more than 30 years in prison. The attack in August 2022 left Sir Salman with severe injuries including damage to his liver, vision loss in one eye and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm. The jury's guilty verdict on Friday came after a two-week trial in Chautauqua County Court in western New York state, near the site of the attack. The jury also found Matar guilty of assault for wounding the interviewer, Henry Reese, who was on stage with the author. Mr Reese suffered a minor head injury during the attack. Matar's sentencing date has been scheduled for 23 April. Sir Salman, 77, testified that he was on stage at the historic Chautauqua Institution when he saw a man rushing towards him. Recalling the incident, he said he was struck by the assailant's eyes, \"which were dark and seemed very ferocious\". He initially thought he had been punched, before realising he had been stabbed - 15 times in total - with wounds to his eye, cheek, neck, chest, torso and thigh. The attack took place more than 35 years after Sir Salman's novel, The Satanic Verses, was first published. The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous. The book  was banned in some countries after it was published in 1988. Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book. But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished. During the trial's closing arguments on Friday, prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt played a video in slow-motion of the attack, the Associated Press reports. \"I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack,\" Mr Schmidt said in court, according to the news outlet. \"There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,\" he told the jury. During the two-week trial, defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan argued that prosecutors had failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman. Matar had pleaded not guilty. His lawyers declined to call any witnesses of their own and Matar did not testify in his defence. In an interview with the New York Post from jail in 2022, Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution. \"I don't think he's a very good person,\" Matar said about the author. \"He's someone who attacked Islam.\" He added that he had only read a few pages of the Satanic Verses. Matar, born in Fairview in New Jersey to parents who emigrated from Lebanon, has also been charged in a separate federal case with providing material support to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, according to an indictment unsealed in July. Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League. Trump said Bongino was \"a man of incredible love and passion for our Country\" and would serve under newly confirmed FBI director Kash Patel. Some departments encouraged staff to respond, while others requested employees wait for further guidance.

        "summary": "An Indian pharmaceutical company is manufacturing unlicensed, highly addictive opioids and exporting them illegally to West Africa where they are driving a major public health crisis in countries including Ghana, Nigeria, and Cote D'Ivoire, a BBC Eye investigation has revealed. Aveo Pharmaceuticals, based in Mumbai, makes a range of pills that go under different brand names and are packaged to look like legitimate medicines. But all contain the same harmful mix of ingredients: tapentadol, a powerful opioid, and carisoprodol, a muscle relaxant so addictive it's banned in Europe. This combination of drugs is not licensed for use anywhere in the world and can cause breathing difficulties and seizures. An overdose can kill. Despite the risks, these opioids are popular as street drugs in many West African countries, because they are so cheap and widely available. The BBC World Service found packets of them, branded with the Aveo logo, for sale on the streets of Ghanaian, Nigerian, and Ivoirian towns and cities. Having traced the drugs back to Aveo's factory in India, the BBC sent an undercover operative inside the factory, posing as an African businessman looking to supply opioids to Nigeria. Using a hidden camera, the BBC filmed one of Aveo's directors, Vinod Sharma, showing off the same dangerous products the BBC found for sale across West Africa. In the secretly recorded footage, the operative tells Sharma that his plan is to sell the pills to teenagers in Nigeria \"who all love this product\". Sharma doesn't flinch. \"OK,\" he replies, before explaining that if users take two or three pills at once, they can \"relax\" and agrees they can get \"high\". Towards the end of the meeting, Sharma says: \"This is very harmful for the health,\" adding \"nowadays, this is business.\" It is a business that is damaging the health and destroying the potential of millions of young people across West Africa. In the city of Tamale, in northern Ghana, so many young people are taking illegal opioids that one of the city's chiefs, Alhassan Maham, has created a voluntary task force of about 100 local citizens whose mission is to raid drug dealers and take these pills off the streets. \"The drugs consume the sanity of those who abuse them,\" says Maham, \"like a fire burns when kerosene is poured on it.\" One addict in Tamale put it even more simply. The drugs, he said, have \"wasted our lives\". The BBC team followed the task force as they jumped on to motorbikes and, following a tip off about a drug deal, launched a raid in one of Tamale's poorest neighbourhoods. On the way they passed a young man slumped in a stupor who, according to locals, had taken these drugs. When the dealer was caught, he was carrying a plastic bag filled with green pills labelled Tafrodol. The packets were stamped with the distinctive logo of Aveo Pharmaceuticals. It's not just in Tamale that Aveo's pills are causing misery. The BBC found similar products, made by Aveo, have been seized by police elsewhere in Ghana. We also found evidence that Aveo's pills are for sale on the streets of Nigeria and Cote D'Ivoire, where teenagers dissolve them in an alcoholic energy drink to increase the high. Publicly-available export data show that Aveo Pharmaceuticals, along with a sister company called Westfin International, is shipping millions of these tablets to Ghana and other West African countries. Nigeria, with a population of 225 million people, provides the biggest market for these pills. It has been estimated that about four million Nigerians abuse some form of opioid, according to Nigeria's National Bureau of Statistics. The Chairman of Nigeria's Drug and Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), Brig Gen Mohammed Buba Marwa, told the BBC, opioids are \"devastating our youths, our families, it's in every community in Nigeria\". In 2018, following a BBC Africa Eye investigation into the sale of opioids as street drugs, Nigerian authorities tried to get a grip on a widely abused opioid painkiller called tramadol. The government banned the sale of tramadol without prescription, imposed strict limits on the maximum dose, and cracked down on imports of illegal pills. At the same time, Indian authorities tightened export regulations on tramadol. Not long after this crackdown, Aveo Pharmaceuticals began to export a new pill based on tapentadol, an even stronger opioid, mixed with the muscle-relaxant carisoprodol. West African officials are warning that opioid exporters appear to be using these new combination pills as a substitute for tramadol and to evade the crackdown. In the Aveo factory there were cartons of the combination drugs stacked on top of each other, almost ceiling-high. On his desk, Vinod Sharma laid out packet after packet of the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail pills that the company markets under a range of names including Tafrodol, the most popular, as well as TimaKing and Super Royal-225. He told the BBC's undercover team that \"scientists\" working in his factory could combine different drugs to \"make a new product\".  People outside the UK canwatch the documentary on YouTube. Aveo's new product is even more dangerous than the tramadol it has replaced. According to Dr Lekhansh Shukla, assistant professor at the National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences in Bengaluru, India, tapentadol \"gives the effects of an opioid\" including very deep sleep. \"It could be deep enough that people don't breathe, and that leads to drug overdose,\" he explained. \"And along with that, you are giving another agent, carisoprodol, which also gives very deep sleep, relaxation. It sounds like a very dangerous combination.\" Carisoprodol has been banned in Europe because it is addictive. It is approved for use in the US but only for short periods of up to three weeks. Withdrawal symptoms include anxiety, insomnia, and hallucinations. When mixed with tapentadol the withdrawal is even \"more severe\" compared to regular opioids, said Dr Shukla. \"It's a fairly painful experience.\" He said he knew of no clinical trials on the efficacy of this combination. Unlike tramadol, which is legal for use in limited doses, the tapentadol-carisoprodol cocktail \"does not sound like a rational combination\", he said. \"This is not something that is licensed to be used in our country.\" In India, pharmaceutical companies cannot legally manufacture and export unlicensed drugs unless these drugs meet the standards of the importing country. Aveo ships Tafrodol and similar products to Ghana, where this combination of tapentadol and carisoprodol is, according to Ghana's national Drug Enforcement Agency, unlicensed and illegal. By shipping Tafrodol to Ghana, Aveo is breaking Indian law. We put these allegations to Vinod Sharma and Aveo Pharmaceuticals. They did not respond. The Indian drugs regulator, the CDSCO, told us the Indian government recognises its responsibility towards global public health and is committed to ensuring India has a responsible and strong pharmaceutical regulatory system. It added that exports from India to other countries are closely monitored and that recently tightened regulation is strictly enforced. It also called importing countries to support India's efforts by ensuring they had similarly strong regulatory systems. The CDSCO stated it has taken up the matter with other countries, including those in West Africa, and is committed to working with them to prevent wrongdoing. The regulator said it will take immediate action against any pharmaceutical firm involved in malpractice. Aveo is not the only Indian company making and exporting unlicensed opioids. Publicly available export data suggest other pharma companies manufacture similar products, and drugs with different branding are widely available across West Africa. These manufacturers are damaging the reputation of India's fast-growing pharmaceutical industry, which makes high-quality generic medicines upon which millions of people worldwide depend and manufactures vaccines which have saved millions of lives. The industry's exports are worth at least $28bn (£22bn) a year. Speaking about his meeting with Sharma, the BBC's undercover operative, whose identity must remain concealed for his safety, says: \"Nigerian journalists have been reporting on this opioid crisis for more than 20 years but finally, I was face to face… with one of the men at the root of Africa's opioid crisis, one of the men who actually makes this product and ships it into our countries by the container load. He knew the harm it was doing but he didn't seem to care… describing it simply as business.\" Back in Tamale, Ghana, the BBC team followed the local task force on one final raid that turned up even more of Aveo's Tafrodol. That evening they gathered in a local park to burn the drugs they had seized. \"We are burning it in an open glare for everybody to see,\" said Zickay, one of the leaders, as the packets were doused in petrol and set ablaze, \"so it sends a signal to the sellers and the suppliers: if they get you, they'll burn your drugs\". But even as the flames destroyed a few hundred packets of Tafrodol, the \"sellers and suppliers\" at the top of this chain, thousands of miles away in India, were churning out millions more - and getting rich on the profits of misery.

        "summary": "Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications. But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots. The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months. A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently. After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users. Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table – committing $3bn (£2.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's \"unmatched\" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential. With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too. But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say. China and the US already have a \"four to five year head-start\", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC. Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index – which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research – India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas. China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent. India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023. India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030. While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of \"patient\" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations. \"Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it.\" Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity. But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent – with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country. The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country. This is partly because \"foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs\", Mr Bindra says. And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors. The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push. The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code. Bengaluru's $200bn outsourcing industry, home to millions of coders, should have ideally been at the forefront of India's AI ambitions. But the IT companies have never really shifted their focus from cheap service-based work to developing foundational consumer AI technologies. \"It's a huge gap which they left to the startups to fill,\" says Mr Roy. He's unsure though whether startups and government missions can do this heavy lifting quickly enough, adding that the 10-month timeline set by the minster was a knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek's sudden emergence. \"I don't think India will be able to produce anything like DeepSeek at least for the next few years,\" he adds. It is a view many others share. India can, however, continue to build and tweak applications upon existing open source platforms like DeepSeek \"to leapfrog our own AI progress\", Bhavish Agarwal, founder of one of India's earliest AI startups Krutrim, recently wrote on X. In the longer run though, developing a foundational model will be critical to have strategic autonomy in the sector and reduce import dependencies and threats of sanctions, say experts. India will also need to increase its computational power or hardware infrastructure to run such models, which means manufacturing semiconductors - something that's not taken off yet. Much of this will need to fall in place before the gap with the US and China is narrowed meaningfully.

        "summary": "Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy, with the US said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally. Last week Narendra Modi said India would take back its nationals who were in the US illegally, and also crack down on the \"human trafficking ecosystem\". \"These are children of very ordinary families, and they are lured by big dreams and promises,\" he said during his visit to Washington. Now a newpaperby Abby Budiman and Devesh Kapur from Johns Hopkins University has shed light on the numbers, demographics, entry methods, locations and trends relating to undocumented Indians over time. Here are some of the more striking findings. Unauthorised immigrants make up 3% of the US population and 22% of the foreign-born population. The number of undocumented Indians among them is contested however, with estimates varying widely due to differing calculation methods. Pew Research CenterandCenter for Migration Studies of New York(CMS) estimate some 700,000 people as of 2022, making them the third-largest group after Mexico and El Salvador. In contrast, theMigration Policy Institute(MPI) puts the figure at 375,000, ranking India fifth among origin countries. The official government data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  offers yet another picture, reporting 220,000 unauthorised Indians in 2022. The vast differences in estimates highlight the uncertainty surrounding the true size of the undocumented Indian population, according to the study. Indian migrants make up only a small share of the overall unauthorised migrant population in the US. If Pew and CMS estimates are accurate, nearly one in four Indian immigrants in the US is undocumented - an unlikely scenario given migration patterns, the study says. (Indian immigrants are one of the fastest-growing groups in the US, surging from 600,000 in 1990 to 3.2 million in 2022.) The DHS estimated in 2022 that the undocumented Indian population in the US dropped 60% from its 2016 peak, falling from 560,000 to 220,000. How did the number of undocumented Indians drop so steeply from 2016 to 2022? Mr Kapur says the data doesn't provide a clear answer, but plausible explanations could be that some obtained legal status while others returned, particularly due to COVID-related hardships. However, this estimate doesn't reflect a 2023 surge in Indians at US borders, meaning the actual number could now be higher. Despite rising border encounters, US government estimates show no clear increase in the overall undocumented Indian population from the US financial year (FY) 2020 to 2022, according to the study. Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country's borders with Mexico or Canada. Visa overstays by Indians have remained steady at 1.5% since 2016. The number of Indian recipients of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) has also declined from 2,600 in 2017 to 1,600 in 2024. The Daca programme protects migrants who came to the US as children. To sum up: the undocumented Indian population grew both in numbers and as a share of all unauthorised migrants, rising from 0.8% in 1990 to 3.9% in 2015 before dropping to 2% in 2022. The US has two main land borders. The southern border along the states of Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas bordering Mexico sees the most migrant crossings. Then there's the US-Canada border spanning 11 states. Before 2010, encounters involving Indians at the two borders were minimal, never exceeding 1,000. Since 2010, nearly all encounters involving Indians occurred along the US-Mexico southern border. In FY 2024, encounters of Indian nationals on the northern border surged to 36% of all Indian crossings, up from just 4% the previous year. Canada had become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with shorter visitor visa processing times than the US. Also, there was a surge in attempted border crossings from 2021 onwards, and the encounters at the Mexico border peaked in 2023. \"This is not specific to Indians. It is part of a larger surge of migrants trying to come into the US after Biden was elected. It is as if there was a high tide of migrants and Indians were a part of it,\" Mr Kapur told the BBC. The study finds that the states with the largest Indian immigrant populations -California (112,000), Texas (61,000), New Jersey (55,000), New York (43,000) and Illinois (31,000) - also have the highest numbers of unauthorised Indian immigrants. Indians make up a significant share of the total unauthorised population in Ohio (16%), Michigan (14%), New Jersey (12%) and Pennsylvania (11%). Meanwhile, states where more than 20% of Indian immigrants are unauthorised include Tennessee, Indiana, Georgia, Wisconsin and California. \"We expect this because it's easier to blend in and find work in an ethnic business - like a Gujarati working for a Gujarati-American or a Punjabi/Sikh in a similar setup,\" Mr Kapur said. The US immigration system allows people who are detained at the border who fear persecution in their home countries to undergo credible \"fear screenings\". Those who pass can seek asylum in court, leading to a rise in asylum applications alongside rising border apprehensions. Administrative data doesn't reveal the exact demographics of Indian asylum seekers, but court records on spoken languages provide some insight. Punjabi-speakers from India have dominated Indian asylum claims since 2001. After Punjabi, Indian asylum seekers spoke Hindi (14%), English (8%) and Gujarati (7%). They have filed 66% of asylum cases from FY 2001–2022, suggesting Punjab and the neighbouring state of Haryana as key migrant sources. Punjabi speakers from India also had the highest asylum approval rate (63%), followed by Hindi speakers (58%). In contrast, only a quarter of Gujarati speakers' cases were approved. US data collected by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) shows Indian asylum requests in the US have skyrocketed. The requests jumped tenfold in just two years, rising from about 5,000 in 2021 to over 51,000 in 2023. While this spike is most dramatic in the US, similar trends are seen in Canada, the UK and Australia, where Indians are among the largest asylum-seeking groups, the study says. Mr Kapur believes this is \"largely a way to game the asylum system rather than an objective fear of persecution, as processing takes years\". Given the large number of Punjabi-speakers who seek asylum, it's unclear what has changed in the northern Indian state ruled by the Congress party (2017-22) and latterly the Aam Aadmi Party (2022–present) to drive this surge. Under Trump's second presidency, asylum requests are set to plummet. Within his first week, a key app for migrants was shut down and removed from app stores, cancelling nearly 300,000 pending appointments, including asylum cases already in progress. US data shows most Indian asylum seekers are Punjabi and Gujarati - groups from India's wealthier states, better able to afford high migration costs. In contrast, Indian Muslims and marginalised communities and people from conflict zones like the regions affected by Maoist violence and Kashmir, rarely seek asylum, the study says. So most Indian asylum seekers are economic migrants, not from the country's poorest or conflict-hit regions. The arduous journey to the US - whether via Latin America or as \"fake\" students in Canada - costs 30-100 times India's per capita income, making it accessible only to those with assets to sell or pledge, the study says. Not surprisingly, Punjab and Gujarat - top origin states for unauthorised Indians -  are among India's wealthier regions, where land values far exceed returns from farming. \"Even illegality takes a lot of money to pursue,\" the study says. While rising asylum claims may seem linked to\"democratic backsliding\"in India, correlation isn't causation, the authors say . Punjab and Gujarat have long histories of emigration, with migrants heading not just to the US but also the UK, Canada and Australia. Remittances - India received an estimated $120bn in 2023 - fuel aspirations for a better life, driven not by poverty but \"relative deprivation\", as families seek to match the success of others abroad, the study says. A parallel industry of agents and brokers in India has cashed in on this demand. The Indian government, says the study, \"has looked the other way, likely because the issue of illegal migration is much more a burden for receiving than sending countries\". Between 2009 and 2024, around 16,000 Indians were deported, according to India's ministry of external affairs. These deportations averaged 750 per year under Obama, 1,550 under Trump's first term, and 900 under Biden. Indian migrant removals spiked between FY 2023 and 2024, but the peak was in 2020 with nearly 2,300 deportations. British trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds is in Delhi to kick-start two days of discussions on the deal. Trump said Bongino was \"a man of incredible love and passion for our Country\" and would serve under newly confirmed FBI director Kash Patel. Some departments encouraged staff to respond, while others requested employees wait for further guidance. The project aims to channel surplus Ken river water to a drought-prone region. In addition to some 4,200 staff who are being placed on leave, at least 1,600 employees are being fired. Copyright 2025 BBC.

        "summary": "In Tulsi, a village in central India, social media has sparked an economic and social revolution. It's a microcosm of YouTube's effect on the world. As villagers head into the fields of Tulsi, a village outside Raipur in central India, on a muggy September morning, 32-year-old YouTuber Jai Varma asks a group of women to join him for his latest video. They gather around him – adjusting their sarees and sharing a quick word and a smile. Varma places an elderly woman on a plastic chair, asks another to touch her feet and a third to serve water, staging a scene of a rural village festival for fans who will enjoy his content from cities and countries thousands of kilometres away. The women, familiar with this kind of work, are happy to oblige. Varma captures the moment, and they return to their farmwork. A few hundred metres away, another group is busy setting up their own production. One holds up a mobile phone, filming as 26-year-old Rajesh Diwar moves to the rhythm of a hip-hop track, his hands and body animated in the expressive style of a seasoned performer. Tulsi is like any other Indian village. The small outpost in the central state of Chhattisgarh is home to one-storey houses and partially paved roads. A water storage tank peers out above the buildings, overseeing the town. Banyan trees with concrete bases serve as gathering spots. But what sets Tulsi apart is its distinction as India's \"YouTube Village\". Some 4,000 people live in Tulsi, andreportssuggestmore than1,000 of them work on YouTube in some capacity. Walk around the village itself and it's hard to find someone who hasn't appeared in one of the many videos being filmed there. The money that YouTube brings has transformed the local economy, locals say, and beyond financial benefits, the social media platform has become an instrument for equality and social change. The residents who've launched successful YouTube channels and found new streams of income include a number of women who previously had few opportunities for advancement in this rural setting. Under the banyan trees, conversations have turned to technology and the internet. February 2025 marks the 20th anniversary of YouTube. Approximately2.5 billion people use the platformper month by some estimates, and India isone of YouTube's biggest marketsby far. Over the decades, YouTube has changed not only the web but the entire way we think about creating and consuming human culture. In a way, Tulsi village is a microcosm of YouTube's effect on the world itself, where for some, their entire lives revolve around online videos. \"It is keeping the children away from bad habits and crime,\" says Netram Yadav, 49, a farmer in Tulsi and one of the many admirers of the village's burgeoning social media scene. \"These content creators have made everyone in the village proud for what they have been able to achieve and do.\" Tulsi's Youtube transformation started back in 2018, when Varma and his friend Gyanendra Shukla launched a YouTube channel calledBeing Chhattisgarhiya.\"We were not content with our routine lives, and wanted to do something that would allow our creative juices to flow,\" Varma says. Their third video, about a young couple being harassed on Valentines Day by members ofBajrang Dal, a right wing Hindu nationalist group, was the first to go viral. The mix of comedy and social commentary struck a chord. “The video was humorous, but it also had a message, and we left it open for viewers to interpret,\" Varma says. The duo gained tens of thousands of followers in a matter of months, a number that's since spread to over 125,000 subscribers and a cumulative viewership exceeding 260 million. Their families' concerns about dedicating so much time to social media were silenced when the money started flowing in. \"We were earning over 30,000 rupees [about £278 or $346] a month, and were able to support the team members who helped us,\" Shukla says. He and Varma left their jobs to pursue YouTube full-time. Their success was soon an inspiration to other Tulsi residents. Shukla says his team paid their actors and even provided training for others in editing and script writing. Some villagers created their own channels, while others were content to volunteer. It was enough to attract attention from local officials. Impressed by the success of the village content creators, the state governmentestablished a state-of-the-art studioin the village in 2023. Sarveshwar Bhure, former collector – a senior civil servant – of the Raipur district which includes Tulsi, says he saw the village's YouTube work as an opportunity to address thedigital divide. \"I wanted to bridge the gap between rural and urban life by providing this studio,\" Bhure says. \"Their videos are impactful, with strong themes, and have reached millions. Setting up a studio was a way to motivate them.\" The bet paid off. YouTube has created a livelihood for hundreds of young people in the village, Bhure says. It's stoking a regional entertainment industry and launching some Tulsi YouTubers out of their small-town life. Of all the social media stars born in Tulsi's YouTube frenzy, none has risen higher than 27-year-old Pinky Sahoo. Growing up in a remote village built around agriculture, Sahoo's aspirations of becoming an actress and dancer felt like a distant fantasy – thanks especially to disapproval from family and neighbours who saw acting as taboo. Despite their criticism, Sahoo started posting dance videos on Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts. Her breakthrough came when the founders of Being Chhattisgarhiya spotted her videos and recruited her for their own productions. \"It was a dream come true,\" Sahoo recalls. \"They recognised my talent and honed my skills.” The momentum continued as her work with Being Chattisgarhiya caught the attention of local filmmakers in Chattisgarh's regional cinema business, and Sahoo was cast in her first movie role. She's since appeared in seven films. Anand Manikpuri, a producer and director in the nearby city of Bilaspur, was impressed by her YouTube performances. \"I was looking for a fresh face who could act, and Sahoo had it all,\" he says. Tulsi resident Aditya Bhagel was still in college when, inspired by Varma and Shukla, he decided to start his own channel. Adapting their techniques, he grew to over 20,000 followers within a year and started earning money from YouTube. Eventually, Varma recruited him for a writing and directing job on the Being Chattisgarhiya team. \"It was like meeting celebrities,\" Bhagel says, recalling his first meeting with Varma and Shukla. More like this: •YouTube statistics Google doesn't want you to know •How America fell in love with China's memes •Are India's TikTok ghosts the app's US future? A job in the production house in the nearby city of Raipur soon followed, where he was hired based on his YouTube work. That streak continued when Bhagel landed a role as a scriptwriter and assistant director for an upcoming, big-budget movie titled Kharun Paar. \"I can only hope that one day I get to work in tinsel town,\" he says. Yet another YouTuber turned cinema professional is 38-year-old Manoj Yadav. He had his first acting role as a child, portraying a young Lord Rama in an annual reenactment of the Hindu epic the Ramayana. Yadav never imagined that those claps would one day echo in cinema halls across Chhattisgarh. After years of showcasing his talent in YouTube videos, Yadav landed a role in a regional film, one that earned widespread praise for his acting skills. Today, Yadav has not only made a name for himself but built an entire livelihood through his craft. \"None of this would have been possible without YouTube,\" he says \"I can't put my feelings into words.\" In Tulsi, YouTube has paved the way for women to take centre stage in this technological revolution. According to Draupadi Vaishnu, the former Sarpanch, or village head of Tulsi, YouTube can play a crucial role in challenging biases and changing societal norms in India, wheredomestic abuseremains a prevalent issue. \"It's common for women to perpetuate [misogynistic practices], especially in how they treat their daughters-in-law. These videos help break those cycles,\" Vaishnu says. Recently the 61-year-old starred in a video addressing the subject. \"I was glad to take on that role because it promoted the importance of treating women with respect and equality, a value I championed during my time as village head,\" she says. Rahul Varma (no relation to Jai Varma), a 28-year old wedding photographer who learned the art from YouTube from his fellow villagers, says the platform has been transformative. \"At first, our mothers and sisters were just helping out. Now, they're running their own channels. It's not something we would have imagined before,\" he says. Even his 15-year-old nephew assists the village content creators, Varma says. \"It is a serious business here, everyone participates.\" There was an explosion of rural content creators in India during the Covid-19 pandemic, particularly on TikTok, beforeIndia banned the app in 2020. That initial wave was primarily driven by men, says Shriram Venkatraman, an adjunct professor of digital anthropology at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi. However, there are a lot more women running successful social media channels post pandemic, Venkatraman says, and that's created new economic opportunities. \"The amount of global connections that it has brought about is transformative, to say the least,\" he says, for both men and women. \"Some even start other businesses from YouTube using their subscribers and content consumers as their initial customer base, for example, hair oil and homemade spices/masalas.\" But for some, money is beside the point. \"I love contributing to the videos produced by my village’s channels, and I do it without expecting anything in return,\" says 56-year-old Ramkali Varma (also no relation to Jai Varma), a homemaker who has emerged as the go-to actress for roles portraying loving mothers, making her one of the village's most sought-after talents. Ramkali's acting roles often address gender issues. A favourite was a supportive mother-in-law who encourages her daughter-in-law to pursue further education, she says. \"I've been able to advocate for women's education and success. Acting brings me satisfaction and peace of mind.\" Now a successful and self-reliant actress, Sahoo hopes to inspire other young girls. \"If I can achieve my dreams, they can too,\" she says, reflecting on the pride of watching her performance on the big screen with her father. In Tulsi, Sahoo has become a role model for young women. \"Seeing girls dream big and aim high is the most rewarding part of my journey. There are girls now who aspire to become filmmakers,\" she says. As the sun sets over Tulsi, Diwar and his team work tirelessly to perfect their hip hop beats. \"Switching from content creation to rap music hasn't been easy,\" says Diwar, whose channel's name is Lethwa Raja, which loosely translates to \"Amazing King\". Diwar hopes YouTube can be a vector for other cultural shifts for his people. \"Not many people rap in our language, but I believe I can change that,\" he says. \"I want to bring a new sound to our region and make Tulsi known for its music as much as its videos.\" -- For timely, trusted tech news from global correspondents to your inbox, sign up to theTech Decoded newsletter, whileThe Essential Listdelivers a handpicked selection of features and insights twice a week.

        "summary": "Zeeshan Ali has been a drag artist for 10 years and has taken his show all over India. Central to his performance is a collection of around 45 wigs. “It’s an alter of identity, helping me transition from my everyday self into exaggerated, glamorous or whimsical characters. The right wig makes me feel more authentic and empowers me to command the stage,\" says Ali, who is based in Mumbai. But getting that look right wasn't easy in the early days. \"When I started my career the accessibility of the wigs was extremely difficult in India. Most of them were to be sourced from abroad or I used to make wigs sourced from whatever was available to me like wool, fabric,\" he says. But things are different now. “The trend is changing. Wigs are no longer just meant for drag or movie artists, but many straight women wear wigs to look different. It's no longer just a hair accessory but a style statement.” Indian hair has always been in demand for wig-making. The nation is the world's biggest exporter of human hair, supplying 85% of global demand. Kolachi Venkatesh, based in Avadi, Chennai, has been collecting hair for 20 years. He started at the bottom of the industry as a picker - collecting hair from households and rescuing it from the rubbish. “My parents were hair pickers and then I started doing the same,\" he says. Hair collected by pickers from homes, salons and barbershops is called non-Remy hair. It requires more processing than Remy hair, which is carefully shaved straight from the scalp. Nevertheless, it has value. \"It’s just thrown away but it's gold,\" says Mr Venkatesh. Those pickers typically sell hair to local traders like Mr Venkatesh for between 10 cents and $1 (£0.80) per kilogram, depending on the quality and length of the hair. Shorter or damaged hair fetches less, while longer strands bring higher prices. For the individual picker, there's not much money in it. “A diligent collector might gather 1–5 kilograms of hair in a day, earning anywhere from 59 cents to $6 per day. This income level is often below minimum wage standards, particularly in rural areas,” says Mr Venkatesh, who has 50 pickers working for him. “While our work contributes to a billion-dollar global market our earnings remain meagre. Intermediaries control prices.” Most of the Indian hair collected by traders like Mr Venkatesh is exported to China where it is made into wigs. “China has a huge wigmaking industry which is worth five to six billion dollars,\" says Benjamin Cherian from Plexconcil, the hair industry body that promotes the Indian industry and liaises with the government. If India wants a slice of the lucrative wig market, he says, then it has a lot of catching up to do. \"When we look at China there are hundreds of factories spread across the country which add value to the hair industry, whereas in India the value addition still needs to be picked up,” Mr Cherian says. He says the government needs to help promote investment in the hair industry. \"It needs automated sorting systems, sophisticated hair treatment procedures for the hair collected, innovative production techniques for manufacturing of wigs which will make India stand out.” Instead of exporting hair for hundreds of dollars, India should be selling wigs worth thousands of dollars says Mr Cherian. “We have started working on it but it’s a long way to go. We need to have research and training centres,\" he says. One Indian business trying to make inroads is Delhi-based Diva Divine Hair, co-founded by Krishan Jalani in 2019. It is currently managed by chief executive and co-founder Nidhi Tiwari. The idea was to create high-quality hair extensions and wigs that would appeal to a broader range of customers. \"There is a growing need for these solutions due to rising issues of hair loss and thinning among women in India,\" says Ms Tiwari. The company has been helped by a shift in attitude. \"Once considered a niche or taboo topic, wigs and extensions are now openly discussed, thanks to evolving social norms and a shift toward acceptance,\" she says. Wigs have also seen a lot of development making them more attractive and comfortable. \"Technologies such as 3D-printed wigs and digital colour-matching tools offer highly personalised options. Lightweight, breathable wig caps and improved adhesives have given customers to wear it for long time without discomfort,\" says Ms Tiwari. At the top end of the hair market is Temple or Remy hair. Much of the supply comes from Hindu temples in the south of the country where hair is shaved off in an act of veneration and faith. Raj Hair International is one of the biggest traders in the Temple hair business. Craftsmen at the company's Chennai factory sort and grade the hair according to colour, texture and length. \"Remy hair has aligned cuticles, hair flows uniformly in one direction, which leads to less tangling and a silkier texture. This is high-value hair,\" says George Cherion, the company's chief executive. The firm tries to waste as little of the hair as possible. To help with that it developed a machine to untangle the hair. It's allowed them to work faster with fewer staff. \"Our mission is to constantly upgrade the technology,\" says Mr Cherion. Business is booming. \"Indian human is in demand globally due to its high quality, natural look, and thinness. The demand is skyrocketing,\" he says.

        "summary": "Warning: This report contains some disturbing details An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced \"unnatural sex\" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women. The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it. Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault. The lower court had also found the man guilty of \"culpable homicide not amounting to murder\". He was sentenced to \"rigorous imprisonment for 10 years\" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently. But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act. The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. \"To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,\" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan. \"An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,\" she told the BBC. \"It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly.\" Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this \"sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder\". She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. \"This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died.\" The court documents make for grim reading. According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, \"committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will… causing her a lot of pain\". After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later. In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill \"due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband\". A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence. While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated \"the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation\" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum. Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently – he questioned the \"sanctity\" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India. The lower court's conviction was \"a rarest of rare case\", Ms Shukla said, \"probably because the woman died\". \"But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge.\" Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly. India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence. A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860. The British colonial-era law mentions several \"exemptions\" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is \"by a man with his own wife\" if she is not under 15 years. Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book. The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is \"implied\" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it. But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape. The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be \"excessively harsh\". The federal home ministry said it \"may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage\". Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency. \"A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,\" Ms Chauhan said. \"But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?\" she asks. Violence within marriage is rampant in India. According toa recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% of married women, aged 18-49, who have experienced sexual violence said their current husbands were the perpetrators. And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame. \"In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,\" the lawyer said. Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes. \"We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out.\" She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a \"man versus woman debate\". \"But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?\" British trade secretary Jonathan Reynolds is in Delhi to kick-start two days of discussions on the deal. The project aims to channel surplus Ken river water to a drought-prone region. The downfall of Masahiro Nakai is a marked departure from how Japan treats claims of sexual violence.

        "summary": "India and the UK will restart free trade talks on Monday, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, is in Delhi, where he will meet his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal to kick off the two-day discussions. Ahead of the meeting, Reynoldssaidit was a \"no-brainer\" to seek a trade deal with India, which was forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach. Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and demands to relax fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a \"top priority\" for his government. \"Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,\" he said in a statement. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to imposereciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffson imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30. The UK had announced inNovemberlast year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year. The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries. London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars. India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times. It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits. During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram. UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru. After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has beensigningagreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs.

        "summary": "Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods. The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam. It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy. But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. \"Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,\" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living. Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009. This could undo years of conservation efforts. \"It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,\" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. A 2023 studypublishedin the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours \"may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive\". Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project. \"We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,\" he said. The government official admitted that there would be a potential \"challenge\" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that \"the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts\". The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song. \"Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,\" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power. \"We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?\" Mahesh Adivasi said. The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given. Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. \"In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,\" he added. But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees. \"Can a house be built with this much money?\" he asked. Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future. \"The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness,\"  said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20. Questions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river. Critics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield. Mr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities \"have all the data to continue with the project\". Mr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting \"a dangerous precedent\" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas. \"And for those affected, it once again underscores how development in India often comes at the cost of the most marginalised,\" he added.

        "summary": "This video can not be played Kohli stars as India beat Pakistan by five wickets ICC Champions Trophy Group A, Dubai Pakistan 241 (49.4 overs):Saud 62, Rizwan 46; Kuldeep 3-40 India 244-4 (42.3 overs):Kohli 100* Shreyas 56; Shaheen 2-74 India won by six wickets Scorecard;Tables Virat Kohli hit a composed unbeaten century as India beat Pakistan by six wickets which put them on the cusp of reaching the Champions Trophy semi-finals and left their opponents on the brink of elimination. Pakistan mustered a rather unthreatening total of 241 after they won the toss and batted first, lacking power, intent and belief against a disciplined India attack. Saud Shakeel and Muhammad Rizwan top scored with 62 and 46 respectively, but they fashioned them off a rather ponderous 76 and 77 balls each. Khushdil Shah boosted the total with a late cameo - whacking 38 off 39 balls - but Pakistan's total felt light at a ground where the average first-innings winning score in one-day internationals is 258. Spinner Kuldeep Yadav finished the pick of India's bowlers with 3-40 while Hardik Pandya's economical eight overs brought him 2-31. Pakistan's hopes flickered when a brutal yorker from left-arm quick Shaheen Afridi swung into India captain Rohit Sharma's middle stump in the fifth over. However, from that point it was a relative cakewalk for India as Kohli guided them to the target with his usual elan en route to his 51st ODI century. Abrar Ahmed produced a fizzing leg-break to dismiss Shubman Gill for 46 with a beauty although it only staved off the inevitable. Shreyas Iyer made an enterprising 56 but the day belonged to Kohli as his hundred off 111 balls, featuring seven fours, guided India home with 45 balls to spare. Ever the showman, Kohli gave the crowd at the Dubai International Stadium a signature moment as he reached three figures in the process of wrapping up the win. With two runs left for victory, and Kohli on 96, the 36-year-old thrashed a powerful drive off Khushdil through extra cover for four to send the India fans wild. India have two victories from their opening two group matches and sit top of Group A while Pakistan have lost both and are at the foot of the table. Should New Zealand beat Bangladesh on Monday then India's place in the knockout phase will be assured along with the Kiwis, and Pakistan will be out. Recap: Kohli times victory to perfection against Pakistan Champions Trophy tables, top run-scorers and wicket-takers This video can not be played Rizwan finally breaks Pakistan's 54-ball spell without a boundary A perpetual narrative around Pakistan is their mercurial nature - a team with mavericks capable of beating any other side on their day. Maybe, it's time to dispense with it. Pakistan's jack-in-the-box surprise element now feels akin to a cliche from a bygone era. The circus is still in town, but the trapeze artists, tightrope walkers and other eye-catching acts are no more. Atepid defeat to New Zealandin their opening game was followed by another disappointing showing in a match which mattered most for the Champions Trophy holders â against their biggest rivals, and upon which the continuation of their title defence would practically rest. Once again Pakistan's fragile and stodgy top order failed to muster the runs which would prove a real challenge to their Indian counterparts. Rizwan and Saud ensured respectability, with a 104-run stand for the third wicket, but much of Pakistan's approach with the bat felt like a template for noble defeat. Haris Rauf, with eight off seven balls, had a strike-rate of 114.28 and was the only player in Pakistan's batting line-up to score at better than a run a ball. They chewed up 147 dot balls in 49.4 overs. The pitch played its part, of course. India squeezed Pakistan through the middle overs, and no boundaries were scored from the first ball of the 16th over to the second of the 25th on a slow surface. Rizwan and Shakeel eventually attempted to up the ante but it brought their inevitable downfall â bowled by Axar Patel, and caught in the deep off Hardik. In the Champions Trophy in 2017, Pakistan lost to India by a whopping 127 runs in the group stage. Fourteen days later, they werecrowned championsafter beating India after an X-Factor knock at The Oval by Fakhar Zaman - ruled out of this tournament after he picked up an injury in the first game. With their hopes now resting on an unlikely series of results a repeat seems a very distant prospect this year.  Virat Kohli's wagon wheel from his 100* off 111 balls against Pakistan With such a modest total, India had the luxury of being able to dictate the pace of their chase, and a player who has frequently been the scourge of Pakistan bowlers inevitably played the leading hand. In 17 ODI innings against Pakistan, Kohli has now scored 778 runs at an average of 59.84 with four centuries. No India player with 500-plus ODI runs in the format averages more against Pakistan. Kohli rarely seemed to break sweat during a chanceless knock which featured shots around the ground, and was characterised by powerful drives, waspish cuts and clinical punishment of anything short. It took Kohli beyond 14,000 ODI runs in 63 fewer innings than his idol Sachin Tendulkar, who is the leading run-scorer in the format. Tendulkar's 18,426 ODI runs might prove just out of reach for Kohli but he is well within striking distance of Sri Lanka's Kumar Sangakkara, who is second on the all-time list with 14,234. One record Kohli did bag was most ODI catches for India as he pouched his 158th and leapfrogged Mohammad Azharuddin (156) and into top spot. The elephant in the room is this match wasplayed in the United Arab Emirates, where India will play of all their fixtures for this tournament. Political tensions mean the two countries have not faced each other outside of men's major tournaments since 2013, while India have not played in Pakistan since 2008. Pakistan would doubtless have benefitted from passionate home support - their fans were outnumbered by India's in Dubai - but regardless of the venue, Kohli would have taken some stopping. This video can not be played 'Vintage Kohli' - India's Virat Kohli best shots against Pakistan India batter Virat Kohli:\"It feels good to be able to bat in that manner. To contribute in a situation like that. My job is to help my team. I'm going to put my 100% in every game. \"I have a decent understanding of my game over the years. It's about keeping the noise and distractions away. I had to take care of my energy levels and my thoughts. It's easy for me to get pulled into the expectations and frenzy of these games.\" India captain Rohit Sharma:\"Virat loves representing the country. He wants to be out there playing for the team and doing what he does best, which is what he did today. People in the dressing room aren't surprised with what he did. \"I think the way we started with the ball was a great effort from the bowling unit. We wanted to back the experience that we have in our batting line-up to go and get those runs.\" Pakistan captain Muhammad Rizwan:\"We thought 280 was a good score on that pitch but their bowlers bowled very well. Myself and Saud Shakeel took our time because we wanted to go deep but after that, there was some poor shot selection. \"They bowled very well, put us under pressure, and that's why we only got 240. When you lose, it means you didn't perform in all departments. They were more attacking and we didn't get the wickets we wanted. We failed to squeeze [them].\" This video can not be played 'World-class' - India's Kohli reaches 14,000 ODI runs Pakistan face Bangladesh in Rawalpindi in their final group match on Thursday.
